# serverless_twitch_to_webhooks
 
This project will consume callbacks from twitch.tv, right now just when a streamer goes online, and then format and forward that information to a callback URl in Discord or Guilded.

Esentially When you go live on a twitch, this will post a message to your discord channel.

And it's all done serverlessly so you do not pay when you're not getting events!
